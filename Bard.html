<h1>Bard</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Music and Magic</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just
vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and
the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods
gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos.
The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and
powers."</p>
<p>Bards have a sterotype of being the charismatic, goofy ones, but that isn't always true. Bards are always charismatic,
weilding pieces of Words of Creation, but they aren't always a street preformer. Some bards may come from soldier backgrounds as drummer boys,
some may not even be musicians at all; the 'art' that drives them can be anything.</p>
