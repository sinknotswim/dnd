<h1>Cleric</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Healers and Warriors</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and
inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of
plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will
benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee
with the power of the gods on their side."</p>
<p>Clerics also, notably, don't have to follow 'good' gods. For instance, Asmodeus is the Lord of Baator, the Nine Hells,
but since he is <i>divine</i> he can have clerics. Or gods of Order. The most important thing to remember is that clerics are
always <i>religious</i>, but D&D religion is distinct from real-life religion.</p>

<h2>Interesting Mechanic?</h2>
<p>Divine intervention! Clerics have the ability to potentially have their god intervene in times of crisis!</p>
