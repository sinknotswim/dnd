<h1>Druid</h1>

<h2>Power of Nature</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and
other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a
mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others
serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called
the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines."</p>
<p>Druids are an interesting class to play because the subclasses vary so wildly; one of the oldest and most popular, Circle of the Moon,
latches on and buffs the Wildshape mechanic, while other druid subclasses are more powerful spellcasters. Just like most of their features,
druids have an immense amount of flexibility for flavor and mechanics.</p>

<h2>Interesting Mechanic?</h2>
<p>Wildshape! Druids can turn into any animal they've seen, so long as it's within their level!</p>
