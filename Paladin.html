<h1>Paladin</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Righteousness</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to
stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever
they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by
the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good,
a paladinâ€™s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god."</p>
<p>Like clerics, it's a good idea to leave any religious imagry you might have from real life at the door with this one;
paladins are usually very religious characters, but it's best to remove any irl ideas. The D&D gods paladins draw from
are typically very different than what we imagine, like Orcus, the orc warmonger god.</p>

<h2>Interesting Mechanic?</h2>
<p>SMITE! Paladins have spell slots they can use to smite, adding extra damage to attacks!</p>
