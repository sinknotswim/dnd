<h1>Ranger</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Hunters</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting
the monsters that threaten the edges of civilizationâ€”humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities,
terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily
through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques
that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes."</p>
<p><b>Important note:</b>Rangers have been in dire need of a revamp since 5e came out with them. Tasha's Cauldron
of Everything 5e sourcebook has done them slight justice; both are table-legal.</p>
<p>As far as the class goes itself, rangers are a tough subject to navigate, as the base ranger class is difficult to play because of
how startlingly underwhelming it is, both in terms of flavor and power. It is best to talk to an experienced player or Dungeon Master first,
because rangers are far from unplayable and can be done well, but it ensures that nobody goes in with the wrong expectations.</p>

<h2>Interesting Mechanic?</h2>
<p>Favored enemy! Rangers get to choose an enemy they focus in on and get things like tracking bonuses or extra damage!</p>
