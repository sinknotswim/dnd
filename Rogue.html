<h1>Rogue</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Skillful and Stealthy</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a
variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few
other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that
help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks."</p>
<p>Rogues are a unique class because everybody is familiar with the sterotype; <i>everybody</i> has heard of the edgy rogue, or the urchin pickpocket.
They have a variety of hard-hitting attacks, but operate very well at a distance, and in stealth, to protect themselves
from danger and prepares them for well-times critical attacks.</p>
