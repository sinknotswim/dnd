<h1>Sorcerer</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Innate Magic</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly
unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines
of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes.
Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own
lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a
mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the
elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of
reality."</p>
<p>Sorcerors are usually reffered to as "naturally gifted", and that's the best way to think of them to distinguish them from
other casting classes. They are born with magic, or awaken it somehow; maybe they were born blessed by a pheonix, or near a wild magic zone, but
somehow Sorcerors <i>have</i> magic, whereas warlocks must bargin for it and wizards must study it.</p>

<h2>Interesting Mechanic?</h2>
<p>Sorcery points! Sorcerors can amplify, upcast, or speed up their spells!</p>
