<h1>Warlock</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Sworn to Patronage</h2>
<p>According to <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite>, "A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being.
Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings
that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince,
an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement
is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of
occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf."</p>
<p>Warlocks are joked about often; "I sold my soul for a 1d10 cantrip" is common. But it's important to not let this
discourage you from playing any class that strikes fancy, even warlocks. Warlocks are unique in the fact that they were non-casters before
barganing for magic; they have a higher hit die because warlocks are inherintly more tanky than other classes, since they gained their powers
through a pact with an otherworldly being, rather than be born gifted or study it.</p>
